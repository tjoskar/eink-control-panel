"""Single source for panel layout (devices, weather, electricity, dishes, garbage).

Both PNG generation (`to_image.py`) and hardware display (`to_display.py`) must
use `compose_panel()` so the layout stays in sync.

Keep layout constants (WIDTH/HEIGHT/PADDING) here to avoid magic numbers.
Each draw_* function receives a shared ImageDraw instance and top‑left anchor.
Sections are resilient: failures are caught and logged.
